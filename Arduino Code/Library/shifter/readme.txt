Shifter PCB Version 1.1

Before loading the example code - shifter.pde into the IDE the library folder - the Shifter folder  must be copied into the libraries folder of the Arduino installation folder eg. C:\Documents and Settings\Roy\Desktop\arduino22\arduino-0022\libraries

Once the IDE has been restarted this will allow your code to access the Shifter functions.

This is a very basic example of driving 2 of our 6.5" 7-segment displays.  Just counting from 0 to 99 and repeating.  Lots of functions can be added/modified for different projects.
